As the haze from the gluttony-infested hive cleared away and the clearing returned to normal, the party spotted [[Ronotte]] coming out of his enraged state. Purple embers still burned at his doublet, causing his right sleeve to burn away. Beneath his sleeve was a hidden tattoo: that of a black [[Dragons|dragon]] with glowing black veins. Though some of [[the Dragonguard]] were frustrated at [[Ronotte]]’s subversion, others understood his reasoning. He assured the group he had no love, loyalty, nor even memory of [[Allunaris]] at all. He swore his blade, [[Allunaris]]’s blade Midnight, would be there at the end to help strike down [[Nizima]], and even [[Allunaris]] should he find some way to return to the world. He also revealed that [[Founders|the Founders]] and those of their blood had some sort of innate connection based on their tattoos. When asked why [[Calathan]] was able to hide his identity if that were the case, [[Ronotte]] theorized that he must not have [[Nizima]]’s tattoo yet. [[The Dragonguard]] continued to urge the Lord of the Queensguard to reveal his identity to [[Zola Artlatta|Zola]], and he said he would consider the prospect. When [[Aura]] and Diluvia reunited with the group, they said their goodbyes to [[Ronotte]] and made their way southwest toward [[Duma Van]] and the lost city of [[Locations/Matar/Mythos/index|Mythos]].
